- 👋 Hi, I’m @JoeAngle68
- 👀 I’m interested in Homeautomation based on ESP8266 and ESP32
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and have no clue how GIT works -> as I am not even a decent programmer it might take years to get to know GIT
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on better nothing, I might break things
- 📫 How to reach me leave a comment in GIT and I reply when I check next time.
Finally, be patient wih me and my repos ;) Br Joe
