- 👋 Hi, I’m Joe
- 👀 I’m interested in Homeautomation based on ESP8266 and ESP32
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and have no clue how GIT works -> as I am not even a decent programmer it might take years to get to know GIT
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on no projects, I just might break things.
- 📫 How to reach me leave a comment in GIT and I reply when I check next time.
-> Finally, be patient wih me and my repos ;) BR Joe
